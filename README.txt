# Dynamic Login Page with Animated Submit Button

## Project Description
This project focuses on creating a dynamic login page with an animated submit button that visually responds to incorrect login attempts. The objective is to enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback when incorrect credentials are entered, while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Design:** A clean and modern interface that includes fields for username and password input.
- **Animated Submit Button:** The submit button will animate (e.g., running effect) when clicked, indicating an attempt to log in. If the login credentials are incorrect, the button will reset and allow the user to try again.
- **Validation Mechanism:** JavaScript-based validation to check the entered credentials against predefined values or data from a database.
- **Error Messages:** User-friendly error messages displayed when incorrect credentials are entered, guiding users to try again.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the login page is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For creating the structure of the login page.
- **CSS3:** For styling the page and creating the animated effects for the submit button.
- **JavaScript:** For handling the validation of login credentials and controlling the animation of the submit button.
- **Backend (optional):** A backend server (e.g., Node.js, Flask) for storing and validating user credentials in a database.
